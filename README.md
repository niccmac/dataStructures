## Linked Lists ...

![Linked List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niccmac/dataStructures/main/public/img/linked-list-concept.webp)

- is a linear data structure.
- each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
- elements are linked using pointers .

### Limitations...

- to add, remove existing elements in a linked list items have to be shifted - this is a costly activity.
- \*\*\* DONT UNDERSTAND YET - The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
